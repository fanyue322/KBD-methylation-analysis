# KBD-methylation-analysis
The code in this repository is the pipeline used for our KBD methylation paper. The main script is main.R which starts from data read from the IDAT files and generates all figures and tables in the results/ directory.

KBD.txt.gz, OA.txt.gz and Control.txt.gz are the processed methylation data for KBD, OA and Control samples respectively, including the CpG sites and the corresponding methylation level(beta value), age and sex information.
